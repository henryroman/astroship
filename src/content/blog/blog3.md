Calamus Nursery proudly announces the grand opening of its newest location, bringing over two decades
of agricultural experience to the forefront of the cannabis industry. They are thrilled not only to be one of
the few nurseries in California to focus on teen production, but also to announce an exciting new
collaboration with Council Collective and their subsidiary genetics brands: Pops & Crxsses.

 The partnership with Council Collective is set to offer superior plants to both cultivators and consumers by
combining the strengths of both companies: the exceptional nurturing environment and cultivation
expertise of Calamus Nursery, and the innovative breeding and genetic advancements of Pops & Crxsses.
Together, they will produce and distribute high-quality cannabis plants with exceptional genetics, ensuring
robust growth and exceptional yields for cultivators.

 Calamus Nursery has emphasized the importance of trust and authenticity in cannabis cultivation. To this
end, they have partnered with several renowned breeders, ensuring that customers receive only the highest
quality strains. These partnerships, including Council Collective, guarantee that the plants meet rigorous
standards, providing assurance to cultivators.

 In response to growing market demands, Calamus Nursery has expanded its inventory capabilities to
provide up to 35,000 highly demanded Teens per month. This significant increase supports a larger number
of cultivators and addresses the needs of an expanding market. The robust inventory ensures that
customers have consistent access to high-quality young plants, ready to thrive in diverse growing
environments.

 “We are committed to delivering clean, healthy plants. All our inventory is rigorously tested and certified
free of Hop Latent Viroid (HLVD). By providing HLVD-free plants, we help our customers avoid the
devastating impacts of this pathogen, ensuring healthier crops and higher yields,” said Tom Olmstead,
Managing Partner of Calamus Nursery.

“The focus on growing Teens is not solely about meeting demand; it is also about increasing efficiency for
cultivation partners. By providing robust, well-established Teens, Calamus Nursery helps customers save
time and resources, resulting in more productive and profitable cultivation operations,” added Tom.
 To better serve large cultivation clients, Calamus Nursery offers the option to order in advance. This
service allows customers to plan their cultivation cycles with greater efficiency and confidence, ensuring
that plants are ready when needed. Advanced ordering facilitates timely delivery and optimizes the
growing process.
